    <b>Daytime</b> is the period when <mark>sunlight illuminates
    a part of Earth</mark>, caused by the planet's 
    rotation on its axis, which causes 
    different parts to face the Sun. The Sun 
    provides light and warmth, with its 
    <mark>apparent path across the sky determining 
    the time of day</mark> and causing the cycle of 
    day and night.

    <mark>The Moon</mark> appears in the <b>night sky</b> because it reflects 
    sunlight, <mark>not because it produces its own light</mark>. While 
    often associated with <b>nighttime</b>, <mark>the Moon is visible 
    in the daytime sky about half the time</mark>. Its visibility 
    during the night is influenced by its phases; <mark>a full 
    moon is visible all night because it's opposite the Sun, 
    while a new moon is closest to the Sun and therefore 
    only visible during the day</mark>, or not at all.
